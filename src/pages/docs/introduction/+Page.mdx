# Introduction

<h2 id="about-kaioken">About Kaioken</h2>

Kaioken was made to provide the expressivity and customizability that React does,
but with a much smaller footprint. It offers simplicity and familiarity at the
cost of being somewhat less fully featured than other libraries and frameworks.

That being said, there are a number of ways in which Kaioken excels, particularly
around flexibility and its ability to quickly incorporate modern features. One
such example is the <a href="/docs/store">Store API</a>, based on Zustand,
available by default as a standard feature.

Kaioken will remain <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/CrimsonChi/kaioken" >open source</ExternalLink> forever and welcomes your ideas and contributions!

There aren't any dates set in stone but the following items are on Kaioken's horizon:

- Fully managed <ExternalLink href="https://vike.dev" >Vike</ExternalLink> integration
  for server-side rendering & static site generation
- Component declaration API with support for <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">Web Components</ExternalLink>
