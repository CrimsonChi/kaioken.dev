<h2 id="about-kaioken">About Kaioken</h2>

Kaioken was made to provide developers with a way to build apps with the expressivity and customizability that React does,
but with a much smaller footprint and more features.

Kaioken will remain <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/CrimsonChi/kaioken" >open source</ExternalLink> forever and welcomes your ideas and contributions!

  for server-side rendering & static site generation
- Component declaration API with support for <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">Web Components</ExternalLink>
