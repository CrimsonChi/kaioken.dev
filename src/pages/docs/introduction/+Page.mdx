    About Kiru
  </DocsSectionHeader>

  Kiru is a lightweight framework designed to empower developers to build applications 
  with expressivity and customizability. It offers a rich feature set while maintaining a 
  smaller footprint, allowing for efficient and flexible development. We are committed to 
  continuous evolution based on community feedback and contributions.

  Kiru will always be <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/kirujs/kiru" >open-source</ExternalLink>, and we encourage developers to share their ideas and 
  collaborate on improving the framework.

    Roadmap

  There aren't any dates set in stone but rest assured, the following items will be on 
  Kiru's horizon:

  - **Full-Stack Rendering:** We aim to enhance support for server-side rendering (SSR) and 
  static site generation (SSG). While current integrations exist with tools like <ExternalLink href="https://vike.dev" >Vike</ExternalLink>, 
  we are working on building our own native solution to simplify these processes.

  - **Compiled Component Declaration API:** This feature will support <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">Web Components</ExternalLink>, 
  enabling developers to create components easily and optimize rendering. The API will 
  focus on performance and integration with existing web technologies. 

  - \***Insert suggestions here**\*: Let us know what you think of Kiru and what you would 
  like to see in the future!
