# Introduction

<h2 id="why-kaioken">Why Kaioken?</h2>

Kaioken was made to provide the expressivity and customizability that React does, 
but with a much smaller footprint. It offers simplicity and familiarity at the 
cost of being somewhat less fully featured than other libraries and frameworks. 

That being said, there are a number of ways where Kaioken excels, particularly 
around flexibility and its ability to quickly incorporate modern features. One
such example is the <a href="/docs/store">Store API</a>, based on Zustand, 
available by default as a standard feature. 

<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

There aren't any dates set in stone but the following items are on Kaioken's horizon:

- Fully featured integration with <ExternalLink href="https://vike.dev" >Vike</ExternalLink> 
for server-side rendering & static site generation
- Component declaration API with support for 
<ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components" >Web Components</ExternalLink>
