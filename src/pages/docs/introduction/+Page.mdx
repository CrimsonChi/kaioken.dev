# Introduction

<DocsSection id="about-kiru" title="About Kiru">
  Kiru is a lightweight framework designed to empower developers to build applications 
  with expressivity and customizability. It offers a rich feature set while maintaining a 
  smaller footprint, allowing for efficient and flexible development. We are committed to 
  continuous evolution based on community feedback and contributions.

  Kiru will always be <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/kirujs/kiru" >open-source</ExternalLink>, and we encourage developers to share their ideas and 
  collaborate on improving the framework.

<DocsSection id="roadmap" title="Roadmap">
  There aren't any dates set in stone but rest assured, the following items will be on 
  Kiru's horizon:

  - **Full-Stack Rendering:** We aim to enhance support for server-side rendering (SSR) and 
  static site generation (SSG). While current integrations exist with tools like <ExternalLink href="https://vike.dev" >Vike</ExternalLink>, 
  we are working on building our own native solution to simplify these processes.

  - **Compiled Component Declaration API:** This feature will support <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">Web Components</ExternalLink>, 
  enabling developers to create components easily and optimize rendering. The API will 
  focus on performance and integration with existing web technologies. 

  - \***Insert suggestions here**\*: Let us know what you think of Kiru and what you would 
  like to see in the future!
