# Custom hooks

Custom hooks allow you to encapsulate reusable logic within your Kaioken components. This documentation outlines the steps and considerations for building your own custom hooks.

**Understanding the Code:**

The provided code snippet showcases the ``useHook`` function, which is the foundation for creating hooks in Kaioken. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

- **<CodePreview data={useHookTypePreview} /> function:**

    - Takes three arguments:

        - ``hookName``: A string representing the name of your custom hook.
        - ``hookData``: An object containing data specific to your hook's logic.
        - ``callback``: A function that defines the behavior of your custom hook. It receives an object containing information about the current execution context and can access the provided ``hookData``.
 
    - Retrieves the Kaioken virtual node (vNode) associated with the component.
    - Validates that the hook is called at an appropriate location (top level of a component or within another hook).
    - Extracts relevant context information from the vNode.
    - Calls the provided ``callback`` function with details about the current state and methods for updating the component or scheduling effects.
    - Stores the used ``hookData`` within the vNode for future references.
    - Returns the result returned by the ``callback`` function.

**Creating a Custom Hook:**

1. **Naming:** Choose a descriptive name starting with `use` (e.g., `useAuth`, `useWindowSize`).
2. **``hookData``:** Define the data structure your hook will use. This can be an object containing state variables, functions, or other necessary information.
3. **<CodePreview data={useHookCallbackTypePreview} /> function:** This function implements the core logic of your custom hook. It receives an object containing details about the current execution context, including:

    - ``hook``: The current ``hookData`` object.
    - ``oldHook`` (optional): The ``hookData`` used in the previous render (if available).
    - ``update``: A function to trigger a re-render of the component.
    - ``queueEffect``: A function to schedule side effects within your hook.
    - ``vNode``: The Kaioken virtual node associated with the component.

4. **Return value:** The ``callback`` function should return the value(s) you want to expose to your component's logic.

**Example (adapted from ``useState``):**

```jsx
function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  return useHook(
    "useCounter",
    { count: initialValue },
    ({ hook, update }) => {
      const increment = () => {
        hook.count++
        update()
      }

      const decrement = () => {
        hook.count--
        update()
      }

      return [hook.count, increment, decrement]
    }
  )
}
```


**Key Considerations:**

- **``shouldExecHook`` function (optional):** You can optionally use a function like `shouldExecHook` to control when your custom hook should be executed based on rendering modes or other conditions.
- **Accessing previous state (optional):** The ``oldHook`` argument in the callback allows you to access the state from the previous render if needed.
- **Triggering re-renders:** Use the provided ``update`` function to trigger a re-render of the component when your hook's state changes.
- **Scheduling effects:** Use the ``queueEffect`` function to schedule side effects that are executed post-update within your custom hook.

By following these guidelines, you can create custom hooks that promote code reusability, improve component organization, and enhance the maintainability of your Kaioken applications.
