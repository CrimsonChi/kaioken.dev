# useId

Generates a unique, stable ID for a component. 
This hook ensures that each rendered instance of a component gets its own 
unique identifier (derived from its position in the tree), 
making it ideal for cases where you need to bind elements like form labels, 
inputs, or any other HTML element requiring a unique id.

The generated id will remain consistent as long as the component's position 
in the application tree remains the same, ensuring that re-renders don't 
break associations between elements, such as form fields and labels.
