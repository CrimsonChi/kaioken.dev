# Signal

A **Signal** is a reactive primitive used to manage state. 
Signals hold a value that can be observed and updated. 
When the value changes, any subscribers to the signal are notified, 
allowing for efficient updates to dependent components.

## General Usage

----

### Creating a Signal

```ts
import { signal } from "kaioken"

const userName = signal("bob")
```

The `signal` function takes an initial value and optionally a `displayName` 
for debugging. This returns an instance of the `Signal` class with the 
following properties:

- **value**: Gets or sets the signal's current value
- **notify**: Emits a signal change
- **peek**: Retrieves the value without tracking reactivity
- **subscribe**: Registers a function to be called when the signal's value changes
- **map**: Derives a new signal based on the current signal's value

### Reading and Writing Signal Values

You can access a signal's value directly:

```ts
console.log(userName.value)  // "bob"
userName.value = "alice"
```

Assigning a new value triggers reactivity, notifying any subscribers.

### Subscribing to Signals

You can subscribe to a signal's value changes using the `subscribe` method:

```ts
const unsubscribe = userName.subscribe((newValue) => {
  console.log("Value updated:", newValue)
})
```

The subscribe function returns an `unsubscribe` function, 
allowing you to remove the subscription when needed:

```ts
unsubscribe()
```

## Derived Signals

---

<CalloutBlock>
  <span className="not-prose text-sm">
    Derived signals are read-only, meaning their value cannot be set directly.
  </span>
</CalloutBlock>

Use `signal.map()` to create a derived signal from another signal:

```ts
const userAge = signal(25)
const userJoke =  userAge.map((age) => 
  `${userAge} walked into a bar... 
  and the bartender said, 'Why the long integer?'`
)
```

Use `computed` to create a derived signal from a getter function:

```ts
import { computed } from "kaioken"

const userGreeting = computed(() => `Hello, ${userName}! ${userJoke}`)
```

The `computed` signal will automatically track dependencies and 
update whenever the tracked signals change.

<CalloutBlock>
  <span className="not-prose text-sm">
  We've snuck a quality-of-life feature in here - signals 
implement `toString()` and therefore are able to be used in strings.
  </span>
</CalloutBlock>


## Signals in Components

----

In Kaioken components, reading and writing signals is slightly nuanced
but has the capability to provide unmatched performance.

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{userGreeting.value}</h1>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={userName.value} 
        oninput={(e) => userName.value = e.target.value} 
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here, `userGreeting.value` and `userName.value` are read directly inside 
the component during render, causing the component to automatically subscribe 
to them. This means the component will re-render whenever `userName.value` 
or `userGreeting.value` change.

While this may be the desired effect, signals can be much more performant
when used for text or attributes. See the following: 

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{userGreeting}</h1>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={userName} 
        oninput={(e) => userName.value = e.target.value} 
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Because the signal's `value` is not read at the time of rendering, **when it 
changes, Kaioken will only change the things that matter** - in this case, 
the text node that displays the greeting and the `value` attribute. 


<CalloutBlock variant="info">
  <span className="not-prose text-sm">
    This is one of the more complex, but powerful aspects of signals.
    The core philosophy around their design is 
    **reactivity via observation, where it matters**.
  </span>
</CalloutBlock>
