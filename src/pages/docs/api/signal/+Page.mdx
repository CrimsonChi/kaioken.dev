# Signal

A **Signal** is a reactive primitive used to manage state. 
Signals hold a value that can be read and updated. 
When the value changes, any subscribers to the signal are notified, 
allowing for efficient updates to dependent components.

## General Usage

----

### Creating a Signal

```ts
import { signal } from "kaioken"

const userName = signal("bob")
```

`signal` takes an initial value and optionally a `displayName` 
for debugging. It returns an instance of the `Signal` class with the 
following properties:

- **value**: Gets or sets the signal's current value
- **subscribe**: Registers a function to be called when the signal's value changes
- **map**: Derives a new signal based on the current signal's value
- **peek**: Retrieves the value without tracking reactivity
- **sneak**: Sets the value without emitting a signal change
- **notify**: Emits a signal change

### Reading and Writing Signal Values

You can access a signal's value directly:

```ts
console.log(userName.value)  // "bob"
userName.value = "alice"
```
<CalloutBlock>
  Assigning a new value triggers reactivity, notifying any subscribers.
  If you mutate the signal's value without assigning to the `value` property, 
  eg. `mySignal.value.something = "test"`, the signal will not notify subscribers. 
  In this case, use **`mySignal.notify()`** to manually trigger an update.
</CalloutBlock>

### Subscribing to Signals

You can subscribe to a signal's value changes using the `subscribe` method:

```ts
const unsubscribe = userName.subscribe((newValue) => {
  console.log("Value updated:", newValue)
})
```

The subscribe function returns an `unsubscribe` function, 
allowing you to remove the subscription when needed:

```ts
unsubscribe()
```

## Computed

---

Use `computed` to create a signal derived from a getter function:

```ts
import { computed } from "kaioken"

const userGreeting = computed(() => `Hello, ${userName}!`)
```

The `computed` signal will automatically track dependencies and 
update whenever the tracked signals change.

<CalloutBlock variant="info">
  We've snuck a quality-of-life feature in here - signals 
implement `toString()` and therefore are able to be used in strings.
</CalloutBlock>

## Watch

---

<CalloutBlock>
  Going forward, we'll refer to the act of reading a signal's value 
  as **observing**. This is one of the more complex, but powerful 
  aspects of signals. The core philosophy around their design is 
  _reactivity via observation, **where it matters**_.
</CalloutBlock>

Use `watch` create a <CodePreview data={watchEffectTypePreview} /> that 
will fire the callback whenever `observed` signals change.
```ts
import { watch } from "kaioken"

const watcher = watch(() => console.log(userGreeting.value))

watcher.stop()
watcher.start()
```
The callback provided to `watch` will fire immediately. 
When a signal that it `observes` changes, it will be queued to fire again 
within a <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/queueMicrotask">microtask</ExternalLink>. 
This allows us to automatically "batch" execution of callbacks.

## In Components

----

### General usage

In Kaioken components, reading and writing signals is slightly nuanced
but has the capability to provide unmatched performance.

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{userGreeting.value}</h1>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={userName.value} 
        oninput={(e) => userName.value = e.target.value} 
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the above example, our `userGreeting` and `userName` signals from earlier 
are `observed` by the component during render, causing the component to 
automatically subscribe to them. This means the component and all of its 
children will be updated whenever their values change.

While this may be the desired effect, signals can be much more performant
when used for text or attributes. See the following: 

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{userGreeting}</h1>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={userName} 
        oninput={(e) => userName.value = e.target.value} 
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Because neither of the signals are `observed` at the time of rendering, 
when they change, Kaioken will only change the things that matter - in 
this case, the text node inside of our heading that displays the 
greeting and the `value` attribute of our input. 


### Using local signals

`signal`, `computed`, and `watch` can all be created locally in Kaioken 
components via the `useSignal`, `useComputed`, and `useWatch` hooks. 
This will allow them to be persisted across renders and automatically 
disposed of when the component unmounts.


```tsx
import { useSignal, useComputed, useWatch } from "kaioken"

function App() {
  const userName = useSignal("bob")
  const userGreeting = useComputed(() => `Hello, ${userName}!`)

  useWatch(() => console.log(userName.value))

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{userGreeting}</h1>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={userName} 
        oninput={(e) => userName.value = e.target.value} 
      />
    </div>
  )
} 
```
