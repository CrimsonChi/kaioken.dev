# Memo

`memo` is a higher-order component that's used for optimizing the performance 
of components by preventing unnecessary re-renders. 
When a parent component re-renders, an identity check is performed for each of the props passed. 
If none have changed, it will not re-render.
You can override this behavior by passing a different `compare` function.

### Example

{siteCodeLang.value === "ts" ? <ExampleCodeTS /> : <ExampleCode />}
