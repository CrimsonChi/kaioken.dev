# Memo

<CodePreview data={memoTypePreview} /> is a higher-order component that's used for optimizing the performance 
of components by preventing unnecessary re-renders. 
By default it will perform an identity check for the props passed. If the props don't change, it will not re-render.
You can override this behavior by passing a different `compare` function.

### Example

{siteCodeLang.value === "ts" ? <ExampleCodeTS /> : <ExampleCode />}
