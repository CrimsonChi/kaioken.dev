# Form

Kaioken's `Form` API provides a simple yet powerful way to handle form state and validation.

Inspired by <ExternalLink href="https://tanstack.com/form" >TanStack Form</ExternalLink>, it
offers a declarative approach to form management, making it easy to manage form state, 
validation, and submission.
