# SWR

Kaioken's `SWR` API provides an easy-to-use layer of abstraction over data fetching and caching.

Inspired by <ExternalLink href="https://swr.vercel.app/" >Vercel's SWR</ExternalLink>, 
it offers a declarative approach to data fetching and caching, 
making it easy to manage data fetching, mutations, caching and invalidation.


### Example
<CalloutBlock>
  The below demonstrates multiple components using the same resource
  fetched by the `useSWR` hook. Only one request is made to the server,
  and the data is cached for future requests.
</CalloutBlock>

{siteCodeLang.value === "js" ? <ExampleCode /> : <ExampleCodeTS />}
