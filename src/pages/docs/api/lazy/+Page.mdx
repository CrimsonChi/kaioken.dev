# Lazy

`lazy` is a higher-order component that's used to dynamically load components, 
deferring the loading of a component 
until it's needed. This is particularly useful for code-splitting, improving the 
performance of your application by loading smaller chunks of code.

A component produced by `lazy` can receive a `fallback` prop, 
which is displayed while the promise is being resolved. 
It accepts a JSX.Element, typically used to show loading indicators.
